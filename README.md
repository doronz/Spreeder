This is my first commercial Android App that has been released to the Google Play store. It is a speed reading app that utilizes Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) in order to eliminate time wasted moving your eyes while reading. It is an effective technique used for many decades that is proven to help increase reading speed.
